# NO DATA VOLUME AS GENERATED. The scaffold writes nothing, and a named volume
# for data that does not exist is a promise the image cannot keep. Add one
# together with the code that writes it, and declare it here and in the compose
# file at the same time.

# ⚠ THE RUNTIME IS PINNED IN TWO PLACES AND THEY MUST AGREE: here and `lint.yml'
# beside it. A generated service that builds on one release and tests on another
# only ever proves "the tests pass on the CI release".
#
# This template said 27 from the beginning and nothing revisited it, so every
# service scaffolded from it inherited 27 while development machines moved on.
# In `hecate-biotope' that cost three commits of red CI on a crash that does not
# occur on the development release at all, and because `build-push.yml' is a
# separate workflow the image shipped to the fleet regardless.

# neither store_id/0 nor data_dir/0 exported), not just for a service that
# declares its own reckon-db store.
